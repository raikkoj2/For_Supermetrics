# For_Supermetrics

This file contains information about my projects and the instructions I had to do them.



**Scala Project**

On my first programming course we had a project in which we were supposed to make a text game. My code may be found from Scala_projekti/o1/adventure/. There is five scala files that contain my code. You can check our assignment from this website https://plus.cs.aalto.fi/o1/2019/w10/ch01/. Keep in mind that this was my first time programming ever so all of my choices weren't maybe the most wisest. This project took about 10-15 hours in total.



**C Project**

I made this project on a basic course of C programming and it may be used to keep count of sold games in a gameshop. Unfortunately, I don't have access to our assignment, but we had a few different commands that we were supposed to do and those commands tested our knowledge of all the matters on the course. This course was my third programming course and this project took about 10 hours of work.



**React**

From the full stack course, I chose this software that shows you country information and current wether in the capitals. However, the UI of the website is very simple, because the focus on this course isn't in css and making elegant websites but the most important thing is to learn how websites are made and how they work. If you want to run this code on your computer, you need to intstall dependencies with npm install and you have to cast an environment variable for the weather api as a access key. You may create your own on this website https://weatherstack.com/ and the variable you need to cast is REACT_APP_API_KEY. This is my latest programming course and this project took about 4 hours.



**Python**

On our website korkeakouluun.com is a Python based calculator that calculates your points based on your matriculation examination diploma. This is mostly my code but my friend Jere Niemi has also helped with some parts. The code may be found from directory laskuri_yliopisto/ and the main file is laskuri_vol2.py. We are still working on this project so all parts of the code don't have excessive comments yet and there may be some extra or old methods as comments. Unfortunately all comments and variables are made in Finnish, because our whole team speak Finnish. This project has taken about 100 hours of coding but I have had to do some parts of the code a few times again, because we have found more information about applying to universities. This was also the first time I was programming with Python.
